AStar
=====
This is a simple A Star search library for all of your searching needs.
It may not be the most efficient, but I'm working to improve it. In
order to use this yourself, you must extend the abstract node class and
put your own code in there (not very verbose, sorry). Read the javadoc,
it'll help.
